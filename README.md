# Event selection dropdown #

## Brief ##
Design and build an event selection drop down for Order search.

Event Organisers want to filter their customer orders by the event(s) the customer purchased for.
To make this easy we want to design and build a simple event selector dropdown that allows the event organiser to select between one and many events.

Build a blank page with a simple form containing:
- An input that allows you to select zero, one or many events
- A submit button.
- Clicking the submit button should post the selected IDs as a comma separated list
